    <p>Hello there! My name is Kaleb Benjamin Schauerhamer.
        Currently, I am studying to be a Software Engineer. Drawing, Dungeons and Dragons, video games, and basketball are my hobbies.
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree. And yes, I am single.

    <p>With our modern, computer centered workplace, knowing how web design works will open many doors. 
        From hospitals to governments, companies to entrepreneurs, every industry imaginable uses a website. 
        This surely will help give me an edge when gaining a sustainable and growing career for the future.

    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the focus on Christ.
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ever since I've been eight.
        I just got back from my mission three weeks ago, and I served in Tacoma, Washington. 
        My favorite scripture is Alma 13:3. 
    </p>
    <p>It's truly a pleasure to get to know everyone, And I hope that y'all enjoyed my webpage!
