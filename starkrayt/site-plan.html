      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Are you tired of stormtroopers mocking your marksmanship? This is a dangerous galaxy, and to survive, you'll need a blaster. 
        Now, you could buy one from the Mining Guild thatâ€™s double price and explodes, or you could get something reliable. 
        This, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am here. I have provided affordable and reliable ships, weapons, and other supplies to everyone from bounty hunters to the New Republic. 
        You can easily access our store, "Star Krayt," from any registered terminal. "With Star Kryat, your security is never more safe." </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended clientele of 'Star Krayt' can be summarized as adventurers. Anyone that wishes to sail the stars.  
        Specifically, we will be looking more at young adult to middle aged individuals with a large variety of occupations. 
        Bounty hunters, Outer Rim settlers, smugglers, and even government officials have done business with us in the early days.
        There should be no reason for us to choose sides in a conflict, that is bad for business. 
        We will be neutral to who buys our products, as long as they don't interfere with our other client's deals.</p>
